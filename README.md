# Audio effects implementation
The purpose of this project was the Matlab implementation of a system that applies audio effects on an input audio recording. The implemented audio effects are:
Flanger, Compression, Reverberation, Tremolo, Overdrive, Panning, Guitar Distrtion, Echo, Fuzz, Chorus, Vibrato, Wah - Wah, Convolution Reverberation and Expansion. The main script of the system is the "main.m". This script accepts an audio file provided by the user and then the user selects between serial and parallel processing. If serial processing is chosen, the user selects which audio effects wants to apply on the input audio file and these effects are applied on the file serially one after the other. The output audio file contains the composition of all audio effects selected by the user. If parallel processing is chosen, each of the 14 audio effects is applied on the input file individually and the result is stored in a separate separate audio file. Also, one more audio file, that contains the composition of all the output files produced from all the audio effects, is produced.
